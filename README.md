## Financial Application
In an attempt to create an interactive app, 
streamlit was used to create a visualization of the all stocks in the S&P 500 and 
how it performed in relation to the sharpe ratio of the bonds and that of the stocks. 
With this app the individual could select a few of the S&P 500 stocks to analyze how it performed in the year 2022 (using the 3y period) 
taking into consideration the risk to reward ratio would be based on the sharpe ratio.
